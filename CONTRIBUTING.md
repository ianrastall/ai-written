# Contributing

## What to contribute

- Corrections (technical accuracy, outdated behaviors, broken examples)
- Improvements (clarity, pacing, better examples)
- Citations/links to authoritative references (docs, primary sources)
- Additional exercises and test cases

## Ground rules

- Keep changes **small and reviewable**.
- Prefer **PowerShell 7+** unless a section is explicitly Windows PowerShell 5.1–specific.
- When adding time-sensitive claims (versions, release status), add an “as of YYYY-MM-DD” note.

## Style

- Avoid aliases in saved scripts.
- Prefer explicit parameter names in book examples.
- Prefer clear, conservative language for security guidance.
