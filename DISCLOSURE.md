# Disclosure: LLM-assisted drafting

This repository contains educational material that may be **drafted with assistance from large language models (LLMs)** and then revised by a human editor.

## What that means

- LLMs can accelerate drafting, examples, and structural outlines.
- LLM output can contain errors, outdated information, or misleading “confident” phrasing.
- The intent of this repo is to keep the material **auditable and improvable**, with corrections tracked via Git history.

## How to treat the content

- Prefer official documentation for authoritative, time-sensitive details (versions, defaults, platform behaviors).
- Treat examples as *illustrative* unless explicitly tested and labeled as such.
- Open issues/PRs for corrections, improvements, and better citations.

## Safety & responsibility

Nothing here is professional advice. Use at your own risk, especially in production environments.
